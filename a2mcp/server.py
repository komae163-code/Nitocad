"""
Real MCP protocol server for NitoCAD, mounted at /mcp on the same FastAPI
app as the existing REST API (web_app.py). Ported from Stitchfren's
app/mcp/server.py - see a2mcp/x402.py's module docstring for why this
replaces mcp-gateway/'s Node "REST route wrapped by a generic x402 package"
approach: that's the shape OKX's A2MCP review rejected on Stitchfren, for
not being integrated with OKX's official Payment SDK.

Requires the `fastmcp` package (added to requirements.txt).

Design decisions, ported from Stitchfren, and one real difference:

- One tool: generate_cad_part. Matches the README's "one real job this
  backend does" framing (parse + generate + validate + STEP/STL export, see
  cad_generator.py's generate_from_text) - no separate parse-only or
  validate-only tools.
- Unlike Stitchfren's run_pattern_job, CADGenerator.generate_from_text is
  synchronous and does blocking file I/O (STEP/STL export, R2 upload) -
  Stitchfren's version was async only because of an optional LLM-narrative
  await. Run it via asyncio.to_thread() below so a single slow generation
  can't block the event loop out from under other requests (including the
  free MCP session-bootstrap methods this same process serves).
- No free preview tool. Stitchfren has draft_and_nest_pattern_preview
  because nesting math is worth showing before charging for the DXF. CAD
  generation here doesn't have an equivalent free-to-compute-but-
  worth-withholding artifact - the whole job is the STEP file. FREE_TOOL_NAMES
  is left empty rather than invented; add an entry here (and a matching
  tool above) if that changes.
- Payment gating happens in X402Gate below, NOT inside the tool function.
  initialize/notifications/initialized/ping always stay free (session
  bootstrap), and tools/list is free once a session exists (i.e. after a
  free initialize) - so a real client can complete the handshake and
  discover the tool without paying. A bare/sessionless tools/list POST (an
  automated x402 prober, not a real MCP client) is still priced - see
  X402Gate/_is_free for the exact rule and why, ported verbatim from
  Stitchfren since it's what OKX's own checker was observed to require
  there (402 on GET, a generic POST body, and a bare tools/list POST, not a
  protocol-level 400).
