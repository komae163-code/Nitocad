BOT Chain payment verification.

BOT Chain has no live native payment protocol yet (AgentPay is still on
BOT Chain's own roadmap, not shipped). This module is a manual
substitute: a caller pays by sending native BOT directly to
settings.TREASURY_ADDRESS, then passes the resulting tx hash to this
backend, which verifies the payment on-chain before crediting the
signed-in wallet.

The only thing this module verifies payments FOR now is
POST /credits/purchase (see web_app.py and config.py's three tiers:
single/pack_1000/pack_10000). /generate, /export/{fmt}/{job_id}, and
a2mcp_botchain/server.py's MCP tools no longer take a payment directly -
they spend prepaid credits (db.consume_credit) instead. See db.py and
wallet_auth.py's module docstrings for the full wallet-session +
credits model this replaced the old per-call-payment one with.

Confirmation threshold is settings.BOTCHAIN_CONFIRMATION_BLOCKS (1 by
default) - accepted as soon as the tx is mined, not re-checked after
more blocks land. Worth noting: ShieldGuard's own on-chain payment
checks (connections.js, webhook.js) don't wait for extra confirmations
either, they accept on receipt.status == 1 alone, so 1-block here is if
anything more conservative than the existing working pattern on this
chain, not a shortcut invented for this project.

Double-spend/replay protection is done by db.py's `payments` table,
which has tx_hash as a PRIMARY KEY. reserve_payment() runs BEFORE any
RPC work, so two concurrent requests carrying the same tx_hash can
never both pass verification - the loser fails on the INSERT itself,
atomically, via sqlite's own uniqueness constraint.

expected_sender binding: reserving a tx_hash only proves it hasn't been
spent *twice* - it says nothing about who the tx_hash belongs to. Chain
data is public, so without a sender check, anyone watching for a
qualifying payment to the treasury could grab someone else's tx_hash
and spend it against their own call first. ShieldGuard's connections.js
and webhook.js both check the payment's sender against an expected
wallet for exactly this reason (see their own comments on the bug this
fixed). POST /credits/purchase always passes expected_sender=the
signed-in wallet, since a wallet session already establishes identity
before the payment check ever runs - there's no "no prior identity"
exception left the way key issuance used to be one.
