# Natural Language to Parametric CAD - Full Version

Convert plain English descriptions into manufacturable CAD files (STEP,
STL, IGES, DXF, PDF) using smart parsing and CadQuery. **Every
generation produces all five formats by default** — see v2.2.1 below.

## v2.2.1: Multi-format export is now the default

`exporters.DEFAULT_FORMATS` (what `/generate` falls back to when the
caller omits `formats` entirely) was `("step", "stl")` — the v2.2.0
export matrix below was opt-in only. Changed the default to all five
supported formats: `("step", "stl", "iges", "dxf", "pdf")`. A caller
that wants the old, narrower two-format behavior back can still get it
by passing `formats: ["step", "stl"]` explicitly — the opt-in mechanism
itself didn't change, only what happens when it's omitted.
`tests/test_exporters.py`'s default-format assertions were updated to
match. One-line constant change, no new logic, but — same standing
caveat as everything export-related below — not yet run against a real
CadQuery/OCP install in this environment.

## v2.2.0: Tier-1 export formats + engine components

Two passes landed on top of the v2.0 hardening pass below, neither of
which the rest of this README reflected until now:

- **Multi-format export (`exporters.py`)** — `/generate` no longer only
  produces STEP/STL. It accepts an optional `formats` list —
  `["step", "stl", "iges", "dxf", "pdf"]` — which as of v2.2.1 (see
  above) is also what it produces by default when omitted. `export_iges` calls OCP's
  `IGESControl_Writer` directly (cadquery 2.3.1's own `exporters`
  module has no IGES `ExportType`). `export_dxf`/`export_pdf` are built
  from a real horizontal section through the solid (layer-classified
  `PIECE_OUTLINE`/`HOLES`/`CENTERLINES` for DXF; a 1:1 scale vector
  drawing with a title block for PDF) — correct for the
  flat/plate/bracket-style parts this catalog is dominated by, **not**
  a full multi-view orthographic projection. New download routes:
  `/download/iges/{filename}`, `/download/dxf/{filename}`,
  `/download/pdf/{filename}`. See `exporters.py`'s module docstring for
  the full scope notes, including why GLTF isn't included.
- **Two new engine-component templates**: `connecting_rod` (small-end/
  big-end bosses with bores, I-beam-style shank, multi-body boolean
  union) and `crankshaft` (configurable throws, main journals, offset
  rod journals, counterweight webs, optional nose/flywheel flange).
  Both are the most geometrically complex templates in the catalog —
  multi-body unions rather than a single extrude+cut — and both caught
  real bugs during development (off-origin bore placement, a "backbone
  cylinder" crank profile that left main-journal material running
  through the throw regions) that are now regression-tested in
  `tests/test_cad_templates.py`.
- **Real MCP server (`a2mcp/`)**, mounted at `/mcp` on this same FastAPI
  app, replacing the standalone `mcp-gateway/` Node service (now
  deprecated — see that section below). One tool, `generate_cad_part`,
  payment-gated per-call via OKX's official Payment SDK
  (`okxweb3-app-x402`) for OKX's A2MCP marketplace.

Combined, the actual part-template count is **25**, not the 23 the
rest of this README used to claim (18 originally shipped + 3 hardware
templates + these 2 engine components) — see `cad_templates/__init__.py`.
None of `exporters.py`, `connecting_rod`/`crankshaft`, or the `a2mcp/`
migration have been run against a real CadQuery/native-dependency
install yet (same standing caveat as everything else below written in
a sandbox with no network access) — run `make test` / `python
smoke_test.py` on your VPS before relying on any of it.

## v2.0: Professional hardening pass

A structural pass focused on config, observability, error handling,
security, and testing — the generation engine itself (parser, templates,
validator) is untouched. Full detail in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md);
highlights:

- **`config.py`** — one typed, validated `Settings` object instead of
  ~15 scattered `os.getenv()` calls. See `.env.example` for every knob.
- **Structured logging** (`logging_config.py`) — JSON or console format,
  per-request correlation IDs, replaces every `print()` in the request path.
- **Real error handling** (`exceptions.py`) — a typed exception hierarchy
  with FastAPI handlers that return the right status code and never leak
  a traceback into a response body.
- **Fixed a path-traversal bug** in the `/download/{step,stl}/{filename}`
  routes (`file_safety.py`).
- **Rate limiting** on `/generate`, `/auth/nonce`, `/auth/verify`, and
  `/credits/purchase` (`slowapi`).
- **`/healthz` + `/readyz`** endpoints for container/orchestrator health checks.
- **A real test suite** (`tests/`) — unit tests for the parser/validator,
  API integration tests, and CadQuery-gated geometry tests covering the
  fillet-degradation and structural-beam regressions noted below.
  Run `make check` for the fast suite, `make test` for everything.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), pre-commit hooks, `pyproject.toml`
  tooling config, a `Makefile`, and a hardened non-root Dockerfile with
  a `HEALTHCHECK`.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for local setup and dev workflow, and [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) for deploying to a VPS with Docker Compose + Caddy.

## Production hardening pass (added after DeepSeek integration)

Persistence, auth, and storage layer added on top of the existing
generation engine - the CAD templates, parser, and validator are
untouched. Mirrors the architecture already proven in the Stitchfren
project: plain `sqlite3` (not SQLAlchemy/Postgres - this project's scale
doesn't need it, generation is a synchronous 1-3s call, not a queued job),
hashed API keys, R2 object storage with local fallback.

> **The API-key auth described in this section was later fully retired**
> in favor of wallet sign-in + prepaid credits - see the "BOT Chain"
> section below for the current system, and `db.py`/`wallet_auth.py`'s
> module docstrings for why. Left as-is here as a historical record of
> what was originally built and why, not as current documentation.

New files:
- **`db.py`** - sqlite3 persistence: `jobs` table (full audit history -
  description, params, output URLs, success/failure, timestamp) and
  `api_keys` table (hashed keys only, raw key shown once at creation).
- **`security.py`** - `X-API-Key` header auth as a FastAPI dependency,
  backed by `db.py`.
- **`storage.py`** - Cloudflare R2 upload for generated STEP/STL files.
  Falls back to serving the local file directly if R2 env vars aren't
  set (fine for local dev, **not fine for Railway** - its filesystem is
  wiped on every redeploy/restart, so any download link handed out
  before R2 is configured will eventually 404).

Changed:
- **`cad_generator.py`** - filenames now use `uuid4()` instead of
  `hash(description) % 10000` (the old scheme collides fast under
  concurrent traffic, and Python randomizes string `hash()` per process
  by default anyway). Every successful/failed generation is now recorded
  via `db.record_job()`. Outputs are uploaded to R2 when configured.
- **`web_app.py`** - added CORS middleware (frontend deploys separately,
  same split as Stitchfren), `POST /api/keys/generate` (bootstrap
  endpoint, same pattern as Stitchfren's demo: called once, cached in
  `localStorage`), `GET /api/jobs` (per-key audit history), `/generate`
  now requires the `X-API-Key` header. The embedded demo HTML's Three.js
  loading was rewritten from the deprecated global UMD build
  (`build/three.min.js` + legacy `examples/js/*` loaders, both removed
  as of three.js r161) to proper ES module imports via an import map.
- **`deepseek_parser.py`** - explicitly disables DeepSeek's thinking
  mode on the extraction call. `deepseek-v4-flash` defaults to thinking
  *on* as of the July 2026 model migration; for a structured-extraction
  call that only adds latency and cost with no benefit.
- **`requirements.txt`** - added `boto3` for R2.

### Public-facing hardening (frontend + auto parser selection)
- **DeepSeek toggle removed from the UI entirely.** The server now
  auto-decides: uses DeepSeek if a key resolves from anywhere (a
  caller-supplied `api_key`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` set in the server's
  own environment), otherwise regex fallback - silently and correctly,
  verified with a functional test of all three branches (no key, forced
  regex despite a key being present, auto-with-bad-key falling back
  cleanly). API/agent consumers that want explicit control still have
  it via `use_deepseek: true/false` in the request body; the demo page
  just doesn't expose it.
- **API-endpoint config box hidden from regular visitors.** Only reveals
  via `?config=1` on the URL, then caches your choice in localStorage -
  same one-time-setup pattern as before, just not shown by default.
- **Part-type count corrected: it's 23, not 18** (the original stat on
  this page undercounted - the real registered count was already 20
  before today, now 23 with the 3 additions below).

### 3 new templates: `cad_templates/hardware.py`
- **`hex_standoff`** - hexagonal PCB/electronics standoff, distinct from
  the round spacer/washer/bearing shapes. Uses `Workplane.polygon()`
  (not used elsewhere in this codebase before now) - its diameter
  parameter is across corners, not across flats, verified against
  CadQuery's own API reference before use, not guessed.
- **`t_bracket`** - T cross-section (cap + stem) extruded along its
  length, built by keeping both pieces in the same plane rather than
  porting `generate_structural_beam`'s i_beam flange/web-then-rotate
  approach directly.
- **`channel_bracket`** - open U-channel (mounting channel / cable
  raceway / cradle), built with `Workplane.shell()` the same way
  `simple_box.py` builds its open-top lid box, just open on a side face.

All three route through both the regex fallback (keyword-matched in
`smart_parser.py` - had to reorder a few `elif` branches since e.g.
`"channel"` alone was shadowing `"channel bracket"`, verified with a
routing test after the fix) and DeepSeek's system prompt.

**Separately noticed, not fixed (out of scope for this pass):**
`generate_structural_beam`'s i_beam construction looks like it may
extrude its flanges only `thickness` deep in one local axis while the
web is extruded the full `length` in a different local axis before
being rotated into place - worth a second look on its own.

### Fixed: `generate_structural_beam`'s flange/web mismatch
The thing I'd flagged-but-not-fixed last round. Confirmed real with a
symbolic bounding-box dry run (pure arithmetic, no CadQuery needed -
computes the world-coordinate range each piece occupies and checks
adjacent pieces actually overlap) before and after the fix:

- **i_beam**: the flanges were built as `rect(width, thickness)
  .extrude(thickness)` on the default plane - only `thickness` deep in
  the beam's length direction, effectively thin end-caps, while the web
  was extruded the full `length` in a different local axis and rotated
  into place. Fixed by building all three pieces (top flange, web,
  bottom flange) in the same YZ plane and extruding all of them along X
  by the same `length` - the technique already used for `generate_angle`
  and this round's new `t_bracket`.
- **channel**: `bottom` was built and then rotated 90°, which (per the
  standard rotation matrix) lands its length-extent on the opposite side
  of zero from `left_wall`/`right_wall`'s un-rotated extent - they
  likely didn't actually overlap. Fixed the same way: build `bottom`
  directly in the same XZ plane as the walls, no rotation.
- **Second-order bug this surfaced**: the fixed pieces were touching at
  an exact coincident face (zero volumetric overlap), a known fragile
  case for OpenCASCADE boolean unions. Gave the web/cap a small
  deliberate overlap margin (`min(0.5, thickness/4)`) instead of relying
  on exact contact - applied to both `generate_structural_beam`'s i_beam
  and this round's `t_bracket` (same underlying pattern, same fix).
  `generate_angle` was checked too and didn't need this - its pieces
  already have genuine volumetric overlap on all three axes.
- **Third bug this surfaced**: `infer_missing_dimensions` (the regex
  fallback) never set `beam_type` at all - every regex-parsed structural
  beam silently defaulted to `i_beam` regardless of whether the
  description said "channel" or "c-channel". Fixed by threading the
  description text through to that function and checking for the
  keyword, verified with a routing test (i-beam, c-channel, and
  no-explicit-type-given all resolve correctly now).

Added `i_beam` and `channel` smoke-test cases so this is actually
exercised against real CadQuery on your VPS, not just reasoned about
here.

### Fixed: fillet crashes found by your first real smoke-test run (2/13 failures)
Both failures threw the same OCCT error (`BRep_API: command not done`)
but were two different bugs:

- **`motor_mount`**: it already applies its own correctly-guarded fillet
  internally (`fillet_radius_mm`, validated to stay under half the
  thickness). But `cad_generator.py` then *unconditionally* ran a
  second, completely separate fillet pass from the regex-extracted
  `operations` list ("5mm fillets" in the text → a raw, unvalidated
  5mm radius) - on a plate that had already been filleted once. Two
  independent fillet systems, never synced.
- **`l_bracket`**: this one is more fundamental - it failed at 1.4mm on
  3mm-thick material, a radius the validator had already deemed safe
  (well under the thickness/2 rule). Proves numeric validation alone
  can't predict OCCT fillet feasibility; it's an edge-topology problem
  (likely at the L-corner), not just a magnitude problem.

Fix, in `cad_templates/_safe_ops.py`: a shared `safe_fillet`/
`safe_chamfer` helper that retries at half, then a quarter, of the
requested radius, and if OCCT still rejects it, ships the un-filleted
geometry with a warning instead of crashing the whole job. Wired into
every direct `.fillet()`/`.chamfer()` call site across the templates
(`l_bracket`, `motor_mount`, `flat_plate`, `t_bracket`, `shaft`'s
chamfer) and into `cad_generator.py`'s generic `operations` pass, with
the warning threaded through to the same `validation_result.warnings`
list that already reaches the API response - for the `operations` path.
Template-level fillets (e.g. `l_bracket`'s) degrade silently for now,
since template functions don't currently have a channel back to the
warnings list - worth adding if this shows up in practice.

Verified the retry/degrade control flow itself with a mock workplane
(no CadQuery needed for this part): confirmed it retries and succeeds
at a smaller radius when possible, degrades to the original geometry
with exactly one warning when nothing works, and never raises. **Not
yet re-verified against real CadQuery** - that's the next VPS run.

### Second round, same fillet issue: silent zero-solids, not a crash
Re-ran on your VPS: `l_bracket` now passes clean. `motor_mount` no
longer *crashes*, but the exported STEP file re-imported with **zero
solids** - OCCT completed the fillet call with no exception at all, but
produced degenerate/empty geometry right at the edge of feasibility.
An exception-only retry loop doesn't catch that; it looks like success.

Fixed by validating the actual result after every attempt (checking
`result.solids().vals()` is non-empty, the same check `smoke_test.py`
already uses for re-imported STEP files) instead of only catching
exceptions. Also improved the warning text to include the real failure
reason (`str(exception)`) instead of just the exception's class name,
so "zero solids" and "hard OCCT crash" don't look identical in the log
- that distinction is what made this one findable in the first place.
Re-verified the full retry/degrade/recover logic with a mock workplane
across 6 scenarios, including the exact silent-zero-solids case seen on
your VPS. Next step is confirming this against real CadQuery again.

### Third round, same fillet issue: solids-count wasn't rigorous enough
Re-ran on your VPS again: motor_mount failed the *exact same way*
(zero solids after reimport) even with the solids-count check in place.
The gap: a solid *object* existing in CadQuery's internal stack isn't
the same as it being a genuinely *valid* one - the fillet can produce
something CadQuery still calls "a solid" that's topologically broken,
which only surfaces as "zero solids" once it round-trips through a
real STEP writer/reader (exactly what the smoke test's own re-import
check does, and what my earlier in-process check didn't).

Fixed by switching from a solids-count check to CadQuery's own
validity checker: `Shape.isValid()`, documented in CadQuery's source
(`cadquery/occ_impl/shapes.py`) as wrapping OCCT's
`BRepCheck_Analyzer::IsValid()` - the mechanism OCCT itself provides
for exactly this kind of defect detection, not something invented here.
Every solid from a fillet/chamfer attempt is now checked with
`.isValid()`, not just counted. Re-verified with a mock workplane
across the exact "succeeds but produces an invalid shape" scenario,
plus regression-tested the earlier zero-solids and hard-exception
scenarios to confirm none of them broke. Next step is confirming this
against real CadQuery again - third time being the actual charm,
hopefully.

### Still not done (Python backend)
- **Not tested against a real CadQuery install** - this environment has
  no network access, so the actual STEP/STL generation path (as opposed
  to the db/auth/storage layer, which is tested) needs verification on
  your machine or in deploy. See `smoke_test.py`.
- **Railway deploy**: pin the Python version explicitly (3.11 or 3.12 -
  OCP's pip wheels don't cover 3.13+ yet) and mount a persistent volume
  for `DB_PATH` if you want job history to survive redeploys, same as
  the R2 requirement for the generated files themselves.
- **Not for Vercel**: CadQuery's OCP dependency is a large native wheel
  stack that exceeds Vercel's serverless function size limit. Vercel is
  fine for hosting a *separate* static frontend only - never for this
  FastAPI/CadQuery backend.

## `a2mcp/` — OKX A2MCP listing (current) and `mcp-gateway/` (deprecated)

**Current**: `a2mcp/server.py` is a real MCP protocol server (via
`fastmcp`), mounted directly at `/mcp` on this same FastAPI app
(`web_app.py` imports `mcp_app`/`mcp_app_gated` and mounts them at
startup — see `app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app_gated)`). One tool,
`generate_cad_part`, matching the "one real job this backend does"
framing (parse + generate + validate + export). Payment gating
(`a2mcp/x402.py`) uses OKX's **official Payment SDK**
(`okxweb3-app-x402`), not a generic community x402 package. Gating
happens in `X402Gate`, not inside the tool function: MCP session
bootstrap (`initialize`/`notifications`/`initialized`/`ping`) and
`tools/list` after a free `initialize` stay free so a real client can
complete the handshake and discover the tool without paying; a bare,
sessionless `tools/list` POST is still priced. `FREE_TOOL_NAMES` is
empty — there's no free-preview tool, since the whole job (the STEP
file) is what's being sold, unlike pattern-nesting-style products
where a cheap preview is worth showing before charging.

Configure via the same `OKX_API_KEY`/`OKX_SECRET_KEY`/`OKX_PASSPHRASE`/
`PAY_TO_ADDRESS` env vars as before (see `.env.example`) — no separate
process or deploy needed now, since `a2mcp/` runs inside the main
backend.

**Deprecated**: `mcp-gateway/` (the standalone Node/Express service,
`POST /mcp/generate-cad`, using the community `@x402/*` packages) is
**superseded** by `a2mcp/` — its own file header now says so explicitly.
It failed OKX's A2MCP review for not integrating the official OKX
Payment SDK, which is the entire reason `a2mcp/` exists. The code is
kept in the repo for reference/rollback only. **Do not point a new OKX
listing at it**; decommission its Railway deployment once `a2mcp/` is
verified live.

**Not yet verified**: no network access in the environment this was
built in, so neither `a2mcp/`'s real MCP handshake nor a real payment-
gated call has been run end-to-end. `okxweb3-app-x402` and
`fastmcp==2.14.7` (`requirements.txt`) were not independently confirmed
against PyPI at time of writing — check before relying on them.

**Still to do on OKX's side**: registering as an ASP and pointing the
marketplace at `/mcp` happens through OKX's own signup flow — not
something this repo can do for you.

**Without OKX credentials configured**: `/mcp` returns a `503` with a
clear `okx_mcp_not_configured` error instead of crashing the whole
backend at startup. This was a real production incident, not a
hypothetical — `a2mcp/server.py` used to call `build_paid_app()`
unconditionally at module import time, and `web_app.py` imports that
module unconditionally too, so an unconfigured OKX listing took down
every route on the backend, including the unrelated BOT Chain ones,
the moment `OKX_API_KEY`/`OKX_SECRET_KEY`/`OKX_PASSPHRASE`/
`PAY_TO_ADDRESS` were all unset. Fixed by catching `PaymentConfigError`
at that call site and falling back to a tiny always-503 Starlette app
for `mcp_app_gated` — deliberately *not* falling back to the free/
unpaid path, since that would silently serve OKX's paid listing for
free, exactly what the original check exists to prevent.

## `botchain_pay.py` / `wallet_auth.py` / `a2mcp_botchain/` / `design_registry.py` — BOT Chain

A second, separate payment rail from the OKX listing above. BOT Chain has
no live native payment protocol yet (AgentPay is still roadmap per BOT
Chain's own materials), so this is a manual pay-to-treasury,
prove-it-with-a-tx-hash flow, not an SDK integration like OKX's.

**Identity: wallet sign-in, not API keys** - and, as of `[3.2.0]`, a
SECOND independent identity path via Google sign-in. `wallet_auth.py`
implements Sign-In-With-Wallet: `POST /auth/nonce` issues a one-time
challenge message, the wallet signs it for free (`personal_sign` - no
gas, nothing on-chain), `POST /auth/verify` checks the signature
recovers to the claimed address and issues a session (`db.py`'s
`sessions` table, an opaque token, revocable by deleting the row - not
a JWT). `POST /auth/google` (`google_auth.py`) is the Google
counterpart - one step instead of two, a Google ID token already IS the
proof, no nonce/challenge needed. It's additive, not a replacement:
Stripe/Paystack-only (no wallet to pay BOT/USDT from), and issues the
exact same *kind* of session under an identifier shaped like
`"email:{google_sub}"` instead of a real wallet address - every other
identity-keyed table (`wallet_credits`, `subscriptions`, `jobs`,
`sessions` itself) accepts it without any changes, since none of them
actually validate that string as an Ethereum address, they just treat
it as an opaque `TEXT` primary key. Every authenticated request sends
`Authorization: Bearer <session_id>` regardless of which identity path
issued it; `wallet_auth.get_current_wallet` resolves it back to an
identity, the same role `security.py`'s `get_current_key` used to play
for API keys.

**Payment: prepaid credits, or a subscription, not per-call.**
`POST /generate` spends exactly 1 generation via `db.charge_generation`
- a wallet with an active subscription draws from that subscription's
pool/daily-allowance first, falling back to purchased credits, a wallet
with no subscription just spends a purchased credit
(`db.consume_credit` - an atomic `UPDATE ... WHERE balance >= ?`,
tested under real concurrent load in `tests/test_wallet_auth.py`).
`POST /credits/purchase` tops up purchased credits at one of three
tiers - `single` (`BOTCHAIN_CREDIT_PRICE_BOT`, 1 credit), `pack_1000`
(`BOTCHAIN_PACK_1000_PRICE_BOT`, 1000 credits), or `pack_10000`
(`BOTCHAIN_PACK_10000_PRICE_BOT`, 10000 credits) - verified the same
way the old per-call payments were (`botchain_pay.verify_and_record_payment`,
checking the tx is mined, sent to `TREASURY_ADDRESS`, for at least the
tier's price, from the signed-in wallet itself). The two packs
intentionally share the same per-credit rate; only `single` pays a
premium for not committing to volume - see `config.py`'s own comment on
these three numbers (repriced in `[3.2.0]` from 0.05/5/50 BOT to
0.01/1/10 BOT once BOT's actual USD price made the original numbers far
more expensive than intended).

**Subscriptions** (`[3.2.0]`, `paystack_pay.py`, `config.py`'s
`settings.subscription_tiers`): three tiers, billed in USD via Paystack,
not on-chain. **Starter** ($5/mo) grants 100 subscription credits per
billing period - a pool that resets and does NOT roll over - throttled
to 10 generations per rolling 24 hours so the pool can't be burned
through in one sitting. **Engineer** ($10/mo) and **Professional**
($50/mo) have no credit pool at all: generation is simply free, nothing
deducted from any balance, up to 30 or 150 generations per rolling 24
hours respectively. "Rolling 24 hours" is deliberate, not a UTC-midnight
or per-wallet-local-timezone reset - see `db.count_generations_last_24h`'s
docstring for the tradeoff (no timezone column needed, no reset-cliff,
at the cost of a `COUNT` query over the `jobs` table rather than an O(1)
counter). A subscriber who exceeds their daily cap (or, Starter, their
pool) falls back to spending purchased credits rather than being
hard-blocked until the window/period resets - an explicit, easy-to-flip
default. **Team ($500/5 seats) and Enterprise (custom) are not
built** - a seat/organization model doesn't exist anywhere in this
app's schema, and Enterprise is normally manual invoicing, neither is a
config tweak.

Runs on **Paystack**, not Stripe, as of `[3.2.0]` (`stripe_pay.py` and
its `STRIPE_*` settings are left in place, unused, as a cheap rollback
path). Mechanically different, not just a relabeling - see
`paystack_pay.py`'s module docstring for what was verified against
Paystack's live docs before writing it: no separate webhook secret
(Paystack signs with the same secret key used for API calls, HMAC-SHA512
of the raw request body, `x-paystack-signature`), no Checkout Session
object (`POST /transaction/initialize` with a plan code returns an
`authorization_url` directly), and a **required real customer email** -
Paystack has no concept of a wallet, so `POST /subscribe/checkout` takes
an `email` field and the frontend asks for it at subscribe time; never
synthesized. The wallet stays the actual identity throughout -
`subscriptions.provider` distinguishes which rail wrote a row,
`paystack_customer_code`/`paystack_subscription_code` exist only for
reconciliation, a webhook resolves back to a wallet via the customer
code (`db.get_subscription_by_paystack_customer_code`), never by
re-deriving one from an email. **USD is not assumed enabled** on the
Paystack account - `PAYSTACK_CURRENCY` must be explicitly `"USD"`,
confirmed in the Paystack dashboard first, or every subscription route
refuses to run rather than silently billing NGN amounts equal to the
USD figures (Paystack does support a USD collections option for a
Nigerian business, but it's capped at $5,000 lifetime until the account
completes CAC registration and upgrades past Starter Business - check
that limit against expected volume before enabling). `current_period_end`
on a renewal is computed as grant-time + 30 days rather than trusted
from an unconfirmed webhook field - Paystack's documented payload shape
for a *renewal* charge (as opposed to the first one) wasn't consistent
across their own docs and third-party integration guides, and every
tier here bills monthly, so this is a deliberate approximation, flagged
in `paystack_pay.py` where it happens, not a silently-wrong assumption.

**Signup bonus**: 10 credits for a wallet, gated on its first verified
payment (BOT/USDT/Stripe/Paystack) - not on wallet creation, since a
wallet costs nothing and is unlimited to create, so gating on connection
alone would have no economic friction and would just be farmed
(`db.claim_signup_bonus`, one-time via a `PRIMARY KEY` insert). A Google
account gets 1 credit immediately on first sign-in instead, no payment
gate - a real Google account has more inherent friction than a free
Ethereum keypair, and 1 credit is a small enough blast radius even if
that assumption turns out wrong (`EMAIL_SIGNUP_BONUS_CREDITS`).

**BOT Chain USDT payments remain explicitly blocked** - not "no
verified address yet," but not to be built at all right now regardless
of address availability. Do not hardcode a USDT contract address found
via web search - a wrong ERC20 address here doesn't fail loudly, it
verifies against a different (or fraudulent) token while real customer
payments go unrecognized. `config.py`'s `BOTCHAIN_USDT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
stays `None` until someone provides one from BOT Chain's own
docs/explorer or from ShieldGuard's existing payment config.

**File Exports (the subscription entitlement) remains explicitly
undefined** - every credit type, purchased or subscription, already
gets free STEP/IGES/DXF/PDF export after the 1-credit generation spend
(see the export section below), so the perk has no content until a real
definition is chosen from: making exports subscriber-only for everyone
else, a not-yet-defined non-subscriber export cost that subscribers are
exempt from, or a new not-yet-scoped capability (bulk export, an export
API, batch formats). Recorded as a named-but-unimplemented entitlement
on purpose, not silently guessed at. Professional's `advanced_engineering`
entitlement gets the identical treatment - named, sellable, unimplemented.

`botchain_pay.verify_and_record_payment` checks the tx is mined, sent to
`TREASURY_ADDRESS`, for at least the required amount — and, wherever an
existing identity should own the payment (a wallet's own credits, a
job's wallet), that the tx's *sender* matches too (`expected_sender`).
That last check exists because of a specific finding from auditing
ShieldGuard's own `connections.js`/`webhook.js`: without it, anyone
watching the chain for a qualifying payment to the treasury could spend
someone else's tx hash against their own call first. Double-spend/replay
protection is `db.py`'s `payments` table, `tx_hash` as `PRIMARY KEY` —
`reserve_payment()` runs before any RPC work, so sqlite's own uniqueness
constraint is the serialization guarantee, not an application lock.
Paystack's equivalent replay guard is `db.mark_paystack_reference_processed`
- a transaction `reference` as `PRIMARY KEY`, same reasoning, since
Paystack redelivers webhooks (a slow response, any non-2xx, their own
at-least-once guarantee) and a redelivered `charge.success` must not
grant the same period twice.

**Free tier**: `POST /preview` — no wallet, no session, STL only, hard
per-IP rate limit (`RATE_LIMIT_PREVIEW`), and deliberately forces the
fallback parser instead of DeepSeek (a free, unauthenticated route
calling a paid external LLM API on every request would be a real cost-
abuse vector). A preview job's `user_id` is `"anonymous"` and can never
be claimed/upgraded to a paid export later — re-submit the same
description through the paid flow instead. This avoids the security
question an upgradeable anonymous job would raise (anyone could try to
claim any anonymous `job_id`). This is also why `GET /download/{fmt}/{filename}`
(below) deliberately keeps anonymous-preview files public even after
`[3.2.0]`'s ownership fix - there's no wallet to check ownership
against, and nothing sensitive to protect on a free, regenerable file.

**On-demand export split, and it's free**: `/generate` only builds and
returns STL — STEP/IGES/DXF/PDF are deferred to `GET /export/{fmt}/{job_id}`
(`cad_generator.export_format_for_job`), rebuilt from the job's stored
`part_type`/`parameters` (same template + same params ⇒ same geometry) -
but not billed again. The 1 credit (or subscription allowance) spent at
generation time covers every format pulled from that job; ownership
(`job["user_id"] == wallet["wallet_address"]`) is what gates the export,
not a second payment. (This used to charge per format on top of the
generation charge - fixed, not discounted - see that endpoint's own
docstring in `web_app.py`.) This is what makes the free preview tier
affordable at all — the expensive multi-format export work only happens
when a format is actually wanted.

**`GET /download/{fmt}/{filename}` is ownership-gated as of `[3.2.0]`** -
it used to be fully open to anyone with the URL, path-traversal-safe via
`file_safety.py` but with no check on WHO was asking, unlike
`GET /export/{fmt}/{job_id}` above. `db.find_job_owner()` resolves a
filename back to the job that produced it (on-demand exports encode
`job_id` in the filename directly; `/generate`'s inline STL uses a
different, non-`job_id` uuid and falls back to a `stl_url`/`step_url`
table lookup), and `wallet_auth.get_current_wallet_optional()` lets the
route serve both public preview output and ownership-checked paid
output through one code path.

**`a2mcp_botchain/server.py`**: a second real MCP server, mounted at
`/mcp-bot` (not `/mcp` — different payment rail, deliberately not
shared). Now uses the same wallet-session + credits model as the web
app: `generate_cad_part(description, session_id)` spends 1 credit, and
`export_format(job_id, fmt, session_id)` is free (included in the job's
credit). A caller signs in the same way a browser does - `POST
/auth/nonce` → sign the message with the wallet's private key (free, no
gas) → `POST /auth/verify` → use the returned `session_id`. This closed
the one gap that blocked migrating it earlier: it never had an
API-key-equivalent identity to fall back on, since the payment
transaction itself used to *be* the identity proof. A wallet session
solves that without needing a payment at all - signing a message is
strictly simpler than sending a transaction, and any caller here
already holds a private key capable of the latter.

**`contracts/DesignRegistry.sol`**: on-chain design provenance, fires
once per job on STEP export only (not every format — `anchorDesign`
reverts on a duplicate `jobId` anyway). Anchors a parameters hash +
output hash + required template version in contract storage for O(1)
lookups, but emits the **full parameters JSON only in the event log**,
not contract storage — deliberate, not a gas-saving shortcut: this
backend's own filesystem is ephemeral across Railway redeploys (see
`storage.py`), so if the raw parameters only lived in this repo's sqlite
db, "reproducibility" would quietly depend on this server staying up
forever. Event data is cheap and permanently readable from chain
history, independent of this backend's uptime. `templateVersion` is
required, not optional — without it, a later template bugfix silently
breaks reproducibility for every design anchored before the fix.
Anchoring is fire-and-forget and best-effort: it can never fail or
block a paid export, since the user already paid for the file
regardless of whether the chain call succeeds. `submitter` (`msg.sender`
on every anchor) is ALWAYS this server's own `ANCHOR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`
wallet, never the paying customer's - the customer never signs this
transaction, the server does, on their behalf, after their export is
already paid for. Product copy referencing this contract must preserve
that distinction: NitoCAD anchors the record on the user's behalf, it
does not mean the user's own wallet signed the provenance transaction.

**Deploying the registry** (`scripts/deploy_design_registry.py`, run
once, manually, per chain): compiles the contract with `py-solc-x`
(`scripts/requirements-deploy.txt` — deliberately *not* in the main
`requirements.txt`, the running API never needs a Solidity compiler),
deploys from `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, writes the ABI to
`contracts/DesignRegistry.abi.json` to commit. The printed address then
has to be set manually as `DESIGN_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` in Railway's env
vars — the script has no Railway API access and shouldn't. Ongoing
anchor calls sign with a *different* env var,
`ANCHOR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` — a wallet this server itself controls and
pays gas from, separate from `TREASURY_ADDRESS` (which only ever
receives, never signs). **`design_registry.py`'s `anchor_design()` was
missing the PoA middleware the deploy script above already uses** -
fixed in `[3.2.0]` (see that changelog entry); every anchor call was
likely failing silently on every export before the fix. Validate with
`scripts/test_anchor_e2e.py` (two distinct jobs anchored back to back,
checked against real chain state, not app logs) before trusting this on
mainnet - written but not yet run against a live chain.

**Not yet verified**: none of this has been run against real
dependencies or a real chain. No network access in the environment this
was built in to install `web3`/`fastmcp`/`py-solc-x`/`google-auth`/`httpx`
or reach BOT Chain's RPC or Paystack's API, so this is syntax-checked and
structurally reviewed against the real repo files, not executed.
`DesignRegistry.sol` has not been run through an actual `solc` compile —
its patterns are matched line-by-line against ShieldGuard's own
already-deployed `ReceiptRegistry.sol`, which is not the same as
compiling it. **Nothing is deployed** — no testnet contract, no funded
treasury or anchor wallet, no end-to-end tested payment, no live
Paystack or Google OAuth credentials. Test all of this on BOT Chain
testnet and Paystack test mode before treating any of it as done, and
before any marketing copy claims "inscribed onchain" as a live feature.

**Known gaps, not fixed**: `frontend/index.html` (the external landing
page) has its own copy of this same wallet-payment and subscription
flow, kept manually in sync with `web_app.py`'s embedded demo — there is
no shared JS module between them, so a future change to one needs the
same change made to the other by hand; this got MORE duplicated, not
less, as of `[3.2.0]`'s subscription/Google-sign-in additions. A
Telegram bot (reusing `botchain_pay`/`cad_generator`/`db` directly,
manual paste-your-tx-hash flow, no WalletConnect) is planned but not
built. Mid-cycle subscription plan changes (upgrading/downgrading tier
before renewal) are explicitly not handled - flagged in
`paystack_pay.py`, not silently broken.

## Deployment topology

Two separate deploys (down from three — `a2mcp/`'s migration into the
main FastAPI process retired the standalone gateway deploy):

| Piece | Where | Why not somewhere else |
|---|---|---|
| FastAPI + CadQuery backend (now includes `/mcp` — see above) | Railway, **Docker** builder | CadQuery's OCP dependency needs system libs (`libgl1` etc.) and a pinned Python (3.9-3.12 only) that Railway's default Nixpacks builder has repeatedly failed to honor reliably (see `Dockerfile` comments, sourced from Railway's own help forum). A Dockerfile removes the guesswork. Not Vercel — OCP's wheel stack blows past Vercel's 250MB serverless function limit. |
| `frontend/index.html` | Vercel / Netlify / GitHub Pages, static, no build step | It's one static file with a configurable API-endpoint box (localStorage), same pattern as Stitchfren's `frontend/`. |

`frontend/` has grown into four static pages, all deployed together
(same host, same build-free setup as `index.html` above) and cross-
linked in each other's nav:
- **`index.html`** — the marketing/landing page, pricing, and the main
  paid demo (wallet connect, generate, export).
- **`preview.html`** — the free, no-wallet preview tool on its own page,
  for iterating on a description before committing to a paid
  generation. Hands the description off to `index.html#demo` via
  `localStorage` (client-side convenience only - free previews stay
  anonymous and unclaimable server-side, same as always).
- **`profile.html`** — job history and credit balance for the signed-in
  wallet, reading `GET /api/jobs` and `GET /credits/balance`.
- **`refine.html`** — the prompt-refinement chat, gated on
  `BULK_TIER_CREDIT_THRESHOLD` (see `config.py`).

`mcp-gateway/`'s `Dockerfile`/`railway.json` are still in the repo but
should not be deployed as a live service going forward (see above).

Before `frontend/index.html` is genuinely public, also tighten
`web_app.py`'s CORS `allow_origins=["*"]` to your actual deployed
frontend domain.

Note there are now two copies of the demo UI: the inline HTML still
served at the backend's own `/` (handy for quick same-origin testing —
no endpoint config needed, works the moment `uvicorn` is running) and
`frontend/index.html` (the one to actually deploy separately for the
OKX listing). They're kept in sync manually; if you change one, change
the other. `preview.html`/`profile.html`/`refine.html` have no
backend-embedded equivalent - they only exist as static pages.

## DeepSeek Integration (real LLM parsing, added after initial delivery)

The originally delivered `smart_parser.py` is pure regex/keyword matching,
no language model involved at all, despite this project's own stated
design principle (LLM parses intent, deterministic templates + CadQuery
do the actual geometry). `deepseek_parser.py` restores real LLM parsing
using DeepSeek's API, `smart_parser.py`'s regex parser remains as the
automatic fallback if DeepSeek isn't configured or the API call fails.

**Not yet verified end-to-end**: no internet access or DeepSeek API key
were available in the environment this was built in, so the real API
call has not been tested. Written against DeepSeek's current, documented
OpenAI-compatible API. DeepSeek has renamed models before (the older
`deepseek-chat`/`deepseek-reasoner` names were retired after July 24,
2026), current names used here are `deepseek-v4-flash` and
`deepseek-v4-pro`, verify against api-docs.deepseek.com if this stops
working.

```bash
# Web UI: check "Use DeepSeek API" and paste a key
python web_app.py

# CLI
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python cli.py --deepseek "mounting bracket for a 50mm stepper motor, 4 holes, 5mm fillets, 3mm thick"

# Python API
from cad_generator import CADGenerator
generator = CADGenerator()
result = generator.generate_from_text(
    "gear with 20 teeth, module 2, 10mm thick, 5mm bore",
    use_deepseek=True,
    api_key="your-key-here"
)
```

**Also fixed while in this file**: `web_app.py`'s JavaScript had a real
syntax bug in the auto-corrections display (`for...of` loop closed with
`});` instead of `}`), which would break the whole script the moment a
request returned any corrections. Fixed.

**Left as-is, worth knowing about**: `llm_parser.py` (the original Claude
integration) is still in the repo but no longer imported by
`cad_generator.py`. **Correction**: `requirements.txt` no longer
carries the `anthropic` package — it was actually removed (it was
fighting `openai`'s httpx version range and causing pip backtracking).
If Claude support is wired back in later, re-add a current `anthropic`
version, not the old pinned one that caused the conflict.

## What's New (All Limitations Fixed)

### ✅ Expanded Part Library (25 Templates — see `cad_templates/__init__.py`)
- **Basic parts**: Motor mounts, L-brackets, flat plates, boxes/enclosures
- **Primitives**: Shafts, bearings, spacers, washers, spheres
- **Transmission**: Gears, pulleys, sprockets
- **Structural**: I-beams, channels, angles, tubes
- **Piping**: Pipes, flanges, elbows, tees
- **Freeform**: Revolved, swept, and lofted shapes
- **Misc**: Hinges, cams
- **Hardware**: Hex standoffs, T-brackets, U-channel brackets
- **Engine components**: Connecting rods, crankshafts (multi-body boolean unions — the most geometrically complex templates in the catalog)

### ✅ Smart Parser
- Regex-based dimension extraction (handles mm, cm, inches, fractions)
- Automatic hole pattern detection
- Material recognition
- Constraint inference for missing dimensions
- Confidence scoring

### ✅ Geometric Validation
- Automatic detection of impossible geometry
- Auto-correction of invalid parameters
- Warnings for edge cases
- Manufacturability checks

### ✅ Assembly Support
- Multi-part assemblies
- Position and rotation constraints
- Export as single STEP file

### ✅ Freeform Capabilities
- Revolved parts (from profile)
- Swept parts (profile along path)
- Lofted parts (between profiles)

### ✅ Enhanced Web UI
- Real-time 3D preview with Three.js
- Interactive orbit controls
- Example library
- Validation feedback
- Auto-correction display

### ✅ Multi-Format Export (`exporters.py`)
- **STEP** / **STL** — original formats, unchanged behavior
- **IGES** — exact B-rep, legacy mechanical CAD interchange
- **DXF** — layer-classified 2D section (outline / holes / centerlines) for laser/plasma/waterjet cutting
- **PDF** — 1:1 scale vector technical drawing with a title block
- All five formats supported, but only STL is built by `/generate` (drives the live preview) — STEP/IGES/DXF/PDF are deferred to `GET /export/{fmt}/{job_id}`, built and paid for individually, only when actually requested. See the BOT Chain section below for why.
- DXF/PDF come from a single horizontal section — correct for flat/plate/bracket-style parts, not a full multi-view orthographic drawing

### ✅ Agent-to-Agent / Pay-Per-Call (`a2mcp/`)
- Real MCP protocol server mounted at `/mcp` on this same backend
- One tool, `generate_cad_part`, priced per call via OKX's official Payment SDK for the OKX A2MCP marketplace
- Session bootstrap and tool discovery stay free; only the actual generation call is gated

### ✅ BOT Chain Payments, Free Preview & Provenance (`botchain_pay.py`, `wallet_auth.py`, `a2mcp_botchain/`, `design_registry.py`)
- Separate payment rail from the OKX listing above — native BOT, verified
  on-chain directly (no SDK, since BOT Chain has no live native payment
  protocol yet), not X Layer/OKX's Payment SDK
- `POST /preview` — free, no wallet, no session, STL-only, rate-limited
  hard per IP, forces the fallback parser (not DeepSeek) so it can't be
  used to burn DeepSeek API budget for free
- `POST /auth/nonce` + `POST /auth/verify` — free wallet sign-in
  (Sign-In-With-Wallet), issues a session used as `Authorization: Bearer
  <session_id>` on everything below - no API key, nothing on-chain, no
  gas, just a signature
- `POST /credits/purchase` — `single` (`BOTCHAIN_CREDIT_PRICE_BOT`, 1
  credit), `pack_1000`, or `pack_10000`; tops up the signed-in wallet's
  balance after verifying the matching on-chain payment
- `POST /generate` — spends 1 credit from that balance (402 if
  insufficient), STL only
- `GET /export/{fmt}/{job_id}` — STEP/IGES/DXF/PDF, built individually
  on demand but **not billed again** - included in the 1 credit already
  spent at generation
- `a2mcp_botchain/server.py` — a second MCP mount at `/mcp-bot`, separate
  from OKX's `/mcp`, with `generate_cad_part(description, session_id)`
  (spends 1 credit) and `export_format(job_id, fmt, session_id)` (free) -
  same wallet-session + credits model as above, see the "BOT Chain"
  section for how an agent obtains a `session_id`
- `contracts/DesignRegistry.sol` + `scripts/deploy_design_registry.py` +
  `design_registry.py` — on-chain design provenance, anchors a params
  hash + template version (not just a file hash) on STEP export, so a
  design is independently *reproducible*, not just notarized. **Not yet
  deployed** — see "Not yet verified" below.

## Architecture

```
User Description
    ↓
Smart Parser (regex fallback, or DeepSeek LLM extraction if a key is configured)
    ↓
Parameter Validation & Auto-correction
    ↓
Template Router (25 templates, cad_templates/__init__.py)
    ↓
CadQuery Template Engine
    ↓
OpenCASCADE Kernel (B-rep geometry)
    ↓
Multi-format Export: STEP, STL, IGES, DXF, PDF (exporters.py)
    ↓
3D Preview (Three.js) + R2/local file storage + sqlite3 job history
```

Only STL comes out of the main generation flow above — STEP/IGES/DXF/PDF
are built separately, on demand, via `export_format_for_job` in
`cad_generator.py`, gated by ownership of the job (not a second
payment - the generation credit/allowance already covers every format).
See the BOT Chain section below.

Also exposed as two separate MCP mounts: `a2mcp/` at `/mcp` (OKX's
official Payment SDK, for the OKX A2MCP marketplace) and
`a2mcp_botchain/` at `/mcp-bot` (native BOT, verified directly on-chain).
Different payment rails, deliberately not sharing a mount.

## Validation Examples

The validator catches and auto-corrects issues:
- Fillet radius too large for thickness → auto-reduces
- Hole diameter larger than thickness → auto-reduces
- Wall thickness too large for box → auto-reduces
- Gear teeth too few → warns about undercut
- Bore too large for gear → auto-reduces

## Extending

### Add New Template
1. Create file in `cad_templates/`
2. Implement function: `def generate_xxx(params: dict) -> cq.Workplane`
3. Register in `cad_templates/__init__.py`
4. Add validator in `validator.py`
5. Update parser in `smart_parser.py`

### Add New Operations
Edit `cad_generator.py` `_apply_operations()` method to support new CadQuery operations.

## Limitations (Remaining)

- Organic/freeform shapes require explicit profile points
- True involute gear profiles (simplified representation)
- Complex multi-body assemblies (basic support)
- Thread generation (simplified holes only)

These are architectural choices for reliability, not technical limitations.

## Performance

- Typical generation time: 1-3 seconds
- Parser: <100ms
- Validation: <50ms
- CAD generation: 500ms-2s
- Export: 200-500ms
