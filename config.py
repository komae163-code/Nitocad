"""
Centralized application configuration.

Every environment variable the project reads used to be a scattered
`os.getenv(...)` call in db.py, storage.py, deepseek_parser.py, security.py,
and web_app.py, each with its own inline default and no validation - a
typo'd variable name silently becomes "not configured" instead of a
startup error, and nothing documents the full set of knobs in one place.

This module is the single source of truth: one `Settings` object, built
once at import time via `pydantic-settings`, validated at process start
(fails fast and loud instead of failing confusingly at request time), and
every other module imports `settings` from here instead of calling
`os.getenv` directly.

Existing env var names are preserved exactly (DB_PATH, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY,
R2_ACCOUNT_ID, etc.) so this is a drop-in change - no .env file needs to
change, only the code that reads it.

    # --- Subscription: Paystack (paystack_pay.py) --------------------------

    # and db.subscriptions.provider already distinguishes rows written by
    # either rail so nothing conflicts if both ever coexist again.
    #
    # Mechanically different from Stripe, not just a relabeling:
    #   - No separate webhook secret. Paystack signs webhooks with the
    #     SAME PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY used for API calls (HMAC-SHA512 of the
    #     raw body, hex digest, in the x-paystack-signature header) -
    #     confirmed against Paystack's current docs before writing
    #     paystack_pay.py, not assumed from memory.
    #   - No "Checkout Session" object. POST /transaction/initialize with
    #     a plan code returns an authorization_url to redirect to -
    #     that's the checkout_url equivalent.
    #   - Requires a real customer EMAIL, not a wallet address - Paystack
    #     has no concept of a wallet. Per the explicit architecture
    #     decision: the wallet stays the NitoCAD identity throughout,
    #     email is only what Paystack needs to run a charge -
    #     db.upsert_paystack_subscription stores wallet_address, email,
    #     paystack_customer_code AND paystack_subscription_code together
    #     so a webhook is resolved back to a wallet via the Paystack
    #     customer/subscription code, never by re-deriving anything from
    #     the email itself.
    #   - USD pricing is NOT assumed enabled. See paystack_pay.py's
    #     module docstring: initialize_subscription refuses to run in USD
