"""
One-off script: compiles and deploys contracts/DesignRegistry.sol to
BOT Chain, then writes the ABI to contracts/DesignRegistry.abi.json for
design_registry.py to load at runtime.

Run this ONCE per chain (once for testnet, again later for mainnet).
It is not part of the running API - it's meant to be run manually from
Railway's shell (or any machine with network access to BOT Chain and
the Solidity compiler), not deployed as a route or triggered
automatically.

Usage (from the repo root, on Railway's shell or similar):
    pip install -r scripts/requirements-deploy.txt --break-system-packages
    export DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...   # the wallet paying gas for THIS deployment
    export BOTCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://rpc.bohr.life   # or your mainnet RPC when ready
    python scripts/deploy_design_registry.py

DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY here is used once, to deploy. It does NOT need to
be the same wallet as ANCHOR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY (the one config.py's
settings.ANCHOR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY holds for ongoing anchorDesign()
calls afterward) - though using the same wallet for both is fine and
simpler if you'd rather manage one key instead of two. Either way, this
script only reads DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY from the environment, never
writes it anywhere, and never touches TREASURY_ADDRESS.

After this script prints a contract address, set it as
DESIGN_REGISTRY_ADDRESS in Railway's environment variables for the main
API service - that's a separate manual step, this script does not do
it for you (it doesn't have Railway API access, and shouldn't).
